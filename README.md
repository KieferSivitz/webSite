**Content Homepage**

Content Homepage is a project that aims to bring many different functions across web sites onto one page.
I started this project because I like to watch livesteams but the chat is too hard to follow and it was annoying
to have to arrange windows to get Twitter and Twitch and however many other sites I wanted open.

**Field Engineer Dashboard**

This project was created while I was working at a startup in Tampa. This was a prototype of an iPad friendly web application for field engineers to view and respond to messages, track projects and other workers, and fill out and submit any relevant forms
