**Content Homepage**

Content Homepage is a project that aims to bring many different functions across web sites onto one page.
I started this project because I like to watch livesteams but the chat is too hard to follow and it was annoying
to have to arrange windows to get Twitter and Twitch and however many other sites I wanted open. The solution was to make a web site to aggregate all of the content I wanted onto one page.

**Google Calendar Reservations**

This project was a school project for a Software Engineering course. The goal of it was to create a simplified interface for users to schedule appointments using google calendar for a barbershop. Currently the create events feature requires a login with a verified gmail account to cut down on spam.

**Field Engineer Dashboard**

This project was created while I was working at a startup in Tampa working on creating an iPad friendly web application for field engineers to view and respond to messages, track projects and other workers, and fill out and submit any relevant forms
